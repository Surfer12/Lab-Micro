What to do for today’s lab: If the reading so far doesn’t make sense, please ask me or people around you to clarify. Here are the steps to go through today (we’ll work through this together). Please document all of what you do for your report. This part of the report will be combined with Wednesday’s part for a complete report due on Monday 2/3.

Here are the steps I want you to include in your report: i. ii. iii. iv. v.

Design the block: The block we’ll build today is the simpler one described in the last paragraph on the last page. The one with a carry-in equal to zero.

a. Understand the problem – Describe what the block does.

b. Create a truth table – Create two truth tables.

One for SUM

one for CARRY-OUT.

c. Find the logic for both the SUM and CARRY-OUT – Use SOP to find logic.

Enter the circuits into LTSpice Make a symbol for the block

Make a new schematic to test the block Test -

Simulate the block for all possible inputs. Include screen captures of your simulation. vi.

I’ll ask you to submit the design files. So make sure back up *.asc and *.asy files. Additionally: vii.

Once you have the circuit working, you will design a simpler block to take the place of the LSB (least significant bit). Note that because the carry in is always zero, it doesn’t need to be an input.

1. Understand the problem
2. b. Create a truth table
3. c. Find the logic viii. ix. x. xii. xiii.
4. Enter the block into LTSpice Make a symbol for the block Make a new schematic to test the block xi.
5. Test (simulate the block)
6. Replace the LSB block with your new block Test and make sure it works
7. In your report follow these steps and include all work to show
