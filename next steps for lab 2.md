NEXT STEPS : 

1. Implementation in LTSpice

• Enter the circuits into LTSpice.

• Create a symbol for the block.

• Develop a new schematic to test the block.

2. Simulation

• Simulate the block for all possible inputs.

• Include screen captures of your simulation results.

3. File Backup

• Ensure that all design files (*.asc and *.asy) are backed up and ready for submission.

4. LSB Block Design (Simplified)

• Overview:

Once the main circuit is working, design a simplified block to replace the LSB (least significant bit). Note that since the carry-in is always zero, it will not be an input.

• Tasks:

• Understand the Problem:

Describe what the new LSB block should do.

• Create a Truth Table:

Develop a truth table for the new block.

• Derive the Logic:

Use the SOP method (or an appropriate logic derivation method) to define the block’s behavior.

5. LSB Block Implementation in LTSpice

• Enter the new block into LTSpice.

• Create a symbol for the new block.

• Build a new schematic to test this block.

6. LSB Block Simulation and Integration

• Simulate the new LSB block to confirm its operation.

• Replace the original LSB block with your new design.

• Test the integrated circuit to ensure everything works as intended.
