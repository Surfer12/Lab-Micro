Let me create a detailed signal routing visualization focusing specifically on the A and B input connections to both XOR and AND gates in a half adder.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Signal Routing Technical Documentation:

1. Input Distribution Architecture
   - Primary Input A:
     • Initial terminal point (0,0)
     • Single branch point at x=60
     • Parallel distribution to XOR/AND
   
   - Primary Input B:
     • Initial terminal point (0,100)
     • Branch point alignment with A
     • Orthogonal routing paths

2. Connection Protocol
   A. XOR Gate Interface:
      • Direct horizontal routing from A
      • Vertical offset routing from B
      • Signal integrity maintained via minimal crossings
   
   B. AND Gate Interface:
      • Vertical drop from A branch
      • Direct horizontal path from B
      • Equidistant terminal points

3. Signal Flow Characteristics
   - Input Signals: [[2c5282]] (Blue)
   - Branch Points: [[4299e1]] (Light Blue)
   - Output Signals: [[c53030]] (Red)

Would you like me to:
4. Add timing diagram overlays?
5. Enhance any specific routing section?
6. Include additional technical specifications?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
