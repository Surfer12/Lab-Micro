I'll redesign the circuit with enhanced signal path clarity and systematic wire routing.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Signal Flow Analysis Documentation:

1. Enhanced Input Routing System
- Primary Signal Paths:
  * Color-coded wire hierarchy (#2c5282 for inputs)
  * Junction points marked with visual indicators
  * Clear branching architecture for dual-gate inputs

2. Logic Gate Integration
- XOR Gate Connections:
  * Direct paths from both inputs
  * Optimized crossing minimization
  * Clear output routing to Sum

1. AND Gate Implementation
- Signal Distribution:
  * Parallel input branches
  * Minimized wire crossover
  * Direct carry output path

2. Visual Hierarchy System
- Wire Classification:
  * Input signals: [[2c5282]] (blue)
  * Internal connections: [[4a5568]] (gray)
  * Output signals: [[c53030]] (red)

Would you like me to:
3. Further optimize any specific signal paths?
4. Add additional routing documentation?
5. Enhance any particular circuit section?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
