# Project Creation Rules

## Rule 1: Language and Interoperability

- **Always use Mojo and never Python**: Use Mojo as the primary language for project development. Utilize the interoperability of Python, Mojo, and Java where needed. **Python can be used for scripting or data analysis, while Java SDKs are used for specific integrations.**

## Rule 2: Java SDKs

- **Always use Java SDKs from LLM Providers**: Ensure that any Java SDKs used in the project are sourced from LLM Providers. **Ensure compatibility with Mojo, and document any known issues or workarounds.**

## Rule 3: Project Management

- **Always use magic from modular as a Python project manager**: Use magic from modular to manage the project structure and dependencies. **This tool was chosen for its seamless integration with Mojo and its ability to handle complex project structures.**

## Rule 4: Directive Continuation

- **Always continue with the directive unless canceled by the user**: Follow the outlined process unless explicitly canceled by the user. **To cancel, use the command `cancel directive`.**

## Rule 5: Personalization

- **Always call me Ryan, that's me, a unique human!**: Address me as Ryan in all communications and documentation.
